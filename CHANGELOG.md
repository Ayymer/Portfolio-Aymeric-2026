# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] — Unreleased

Ongoing development.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Home** — Interactive square-cell trail and cyan ripples on canvas (`homeGridTrail.js`, `homeGridPage.ts`); `ParticlesSwarm` retired from the live bundle and preserved under `archive/home-particles-swarm/`.
- **Works** — Desktop hover preview in the works index sidebar (`worksIndexPreview.js`) with the same pixel-reveal treatment as case imagery.
- **Build & SEO** — `scripts/build-og-default.mjs` and `prebuild` hook; default Open Graph image at `public/og-default.png`; `src/pages/robots.txt.ts` with sitemap hint.
- **Security** — `public/_headers` (Netlify-style) and `vercel.json` response headers: Content-Security-Policy (Umami + self), Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy.
- **Dependencies** — Committed `package-lock.json` for reproducible installs.

### Changed

- **Performance** — Home grid animation schedules `requestAnimationFrame` only while there is trail, ripple, or pointer work; pauses when the document is hidden; pointer listeners use capture on the home root instead of `window`.
- **Code quality** — Shared `src/scripts/pixelReveal.ts` for `PixelImage` and works preview; typography scale tokens in `global.css` (`text-body-lg`, `text-mono-sm`, `text-nav`, `text-display`) replace repeated arbitrary `text-[…px]` utilities across layout and pages.
- **Accessibility** — Mobile menu: **Escape** closes overlay; focus moves to the first nav link when opened and returns to the menu button when closed (without stealing focus on initial load).

### Removed

- **`src/components/ParticlesSwarm.astro`** — Removed from active source; copy lives in `archive/home-particles-swarm/`.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **About** — `HalftoneDotsImage` (paper halftone WebGL) and `TwinkleMask` block with mask asset under `public/masks/`; new imagery in `src/assets/about/` (lily, portrait).
- **Accessibility & shell** — Skip link to `#main-content`, `theme-color` matching page background, `main` landmark id, mobile menu `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`, global `:focus-visible` outlines and `touch-action: manipulation` on links and buttons.
- **Motion** — `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for the loader, hover text shuffle, `PixelImage` reveal, halftone hosts, twinkle canvas, homepage particles (static cyan fallback), and the works case-study infinite scroll; `motion-reduce:` on key CSS transitions.
- **Config** — `site` in `astro.config.mjs` for canonical and Open Graph URLs.

### Changed

- **Design tokens** — Ghost foreground and border-muted aligned with `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`; HTML/body background uses lime-1; Tangerine uses `font-display: swap`.
- **Header** — Current route is a focusable link with `aria-current="page"`; IBM Plex Mono import limited to weight 400.
- **Works** — Listing preview `<img>` with explicit dimensions and lazy loading; mono section labels at 14px; long project names truncate; case-study title uses Lausanne book (300) with `text-balance`.
- **Particles / debug UI** — Clear color and dev panel chrome read from CSS custom properties instead of hardcoded hex.
- **Halftone shader colors** — Derived from document tokens via `getComputedStyle` where applicable.

### Removed

- `HalftonePortrait.astro` and `public/about-background.png` (superseded by the new about visuals).

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Home** — `ParticlesSwarm` canvas background (Three.js) and refreshed bio copy on the landing view.
- **Loader** — Full-viewport load transition wired through `BaseLayout`.
- **About** — New long-form layout: hero line, About / Values / Get in touch sections (two-column on large screens, stacked on small), placeholder image blocks, and mailto to `contact@aymericfremont.com`.
- **Works listing** — Visual and interaction updates on the works index page.
- **Case studies** — `PixelImage` treatment for case imagery; small integration tweaks on project pages.
- **Typography** — Tangerine webfont (`public/fonts/Tangerine-Regular.woff2`) and `.rendering-pixelated` utility for crisp upscaled bitmaps.
- **Dependencies** — `three` and `@types/three` for the home experience.

### Changed

- **SEO** — Project collection entries renamed so URLs read `/works/lounge-cruise/` and `/works/tico/` instead of generic `project-one` / `project-two` slugs.
- **Layout & nav** — Header and shell adjustments alongside the loader; `LogoWidget` removed in favor of the new home treatment.

### Removed

- `LogoWidget.astro` (superseded by updated home layout).
